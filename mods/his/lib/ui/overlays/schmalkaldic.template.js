	A Military Alliance is formed among the Lutheran Princes in defense of the bourgeoning Protestant vision against the machinations of the Hapsburgs under Charles V. The Protestants may now:

	<ul>
	  <li>raise regulars, mercenaries</li>
	  <li>move units across board</li>
	  <li>take political control of spaces</li>
	  <li>conduct sieges, assaults and field battles</li>
	</ul>

	All terrorities under Protestant religious influences are now Protestant Home Spaces under Protestant political control. Military units may be raised in these, and only these, spaces.
