This is an demonstration implementation of Pandemic written for the open source Saito Game Engine. This version supports 2-player games with limited role selection and a restricted set of gaming features. The game engine itself is written to work with the Pandemic VASSAL module, a similar open source gaming engine which has made Pandemic available to the general public for at least the last four years. That module can be downloaded here:

http://www.vassalengine.org/mediawiki/images/9/96/Pandemic_All_3_Expansions_1.0.vmod

To finish setting up this module to work on Saito, simply download and unzip this VMOD file. Then copy the contents of the ./images directory you unzipped into the "images" directory of this Saito module. Then add the module to your Saito install and recompile as usual.

All users should please note that game publishers traditionally make their materials available on Vassal to do so under the following conditions:

    1. The game files may only be used by open source, non-commercial game engines

    2. At least ONE player in every game should have purchased a commercial copy of the game.

While this module is released for free use on the Saito Game Engine, please respect the terms of VASSAL usage when using the game graphics and other materials from the VASSAL module. Pandemic and many other great games can be purchased directly from ZMan games here:
