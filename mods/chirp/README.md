# Saito-Social-Network

This is a Saito Module that runs an open source Twitter-style service over
the Saito network. All posts and interactions with the blockchain will be
in the form of transactions which can be cryptographically-signed and 
distributed over the blockchain or peer-to-peer as needs demand.

This will create a version of Twitter without the need for any central 
servers. In a worst-case scenario, users can store content themselves and
distribute it to their own peers on connect, allowing the entire network 
to run like a gossip protocol.

We are a long way from being complete. Right now this module just displays 
a quick interface, and hooks into the default Saito Header and Saito Chat. 
The next steps are to simplify the interface and move towards having a 
MVP: creating something that we enjoy using and building as a community.

If you would like to get involved in making this module a reality, please
reach out. We could use help from anyone who has experience with HTML, 
CSS or JS and wants to help out.
