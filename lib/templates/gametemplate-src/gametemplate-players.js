  This is the default Player Turn function. It should be replaced in any 
  game by code logic that specifies what players actually do. Their moves
  should be added to the queue using addMove() and then endTurn() to 
  submit those moves to all other players.

  Note that other players will execute the contents of this queue in 
  reverse order. Complicated game moves that require conditional should
  be handled in .

  The PLAY instruction does not "fall-out" automatically (it will keep 
  coming back to the player whose turn it is. This is deliberate design.
  In order to remove this move, RESOLVE command must be issued by the 
  player whose turn it is. This will permit the queue to clear and 
  the game will continue with the next player.
