			<h2>What is Saito and Why is it Important?</h2>

			<p></p>

			Saito is a blockchain designed to process terabytes of data on a
			rolling basis. Our long-term goal is to handle over 100 terabytes
			each day while providing the same level of security as bitcoin.

			<p></p>

			The reason we need to support such a large amount of data is that
			Saito is more than a payments layer: buried within each Saito
			transaction is a signed message field that applications can use to
			send their own data along with transactions. By allowing
			applications to define their own protocol for how this data is
			formatted, we essentially create an application platform capable of
			running decentralized alternatives to services like email, social
			networks, domain-name registries and more.

			<p></p>

			While there are various projects that use blockchain technology to
			build similar applications, none has the flexibility or scalability
			of Saito. The first reason for this is that other networks use
			traditional blockchains and thus require all nodes in the network to
			store their entire blockchain in perpetuity. A more subtle way in
			which other approaches fail is that they rely on proof-of-work and
			proof-of-stake variants for securing the network, and these methods
			have no way to compensate nodes in the peer-to-peer network for
			supplying the bandwidth needed by high-traffic applications.
			Proof-of-work networks that expect miners to support the entire
			network suffer scaling and centralization pressures as bandwidth use
			and mining difficulty becomes more extreme.

			<p></p>

			Saito solves all of these problems through an entirely new
			blockchain design. By doing so, it ushers in the era of truly
			decentralized blockchain applications (distinguishable from "smart
			contracts" in the way they run on the edge of the network and face
			no limitations on computational resources other than those imposed
			by the end-node itself). As unlike smart contracts, Saito
			applications can also upgrade their protocols and software without
			forcing a general network upgrade. Not only does this flexibility
			allow the Saito blockchain to be used for applications that have
			historically been impossible to decentralize, but it pushes
			innovation to the edge of the network and prevents web services from
			getting monopolized by a small team of developers: anyone who can
			use an application can modify it simply by editing the source code.

			<p></p>

			What can we do with this new type of blockchain? Our online demos
			showcase several possibilities: decentralized email and social media
			platforms. While these applications may seem like traditional
			web-apps, they are in fact radically different. In our email client,
			email messages are in fact transactions broadcast and received
			directly across the blockchain. In our social media client, our
			ability to publish "posts" and "status updates" across the
			blockchain allows us to eliminate points of centralization and
			censorship from the network: servers can moderate and remove content
			for their own users, but they cannot censor the underlying
			blockchain along which data passes as a common carrier. And anyone
			upset at any moderator's editorial policy can either run a full-node
			for access to all network traffic, or switch to another server with
			a more restrictive/permissive touch.

			<p></p>

			More interesting possibilities emerge once we realize that we can
			use our big-data blockchain to build decentralized consensus. One
			example of an application like this is a decentralized DNS system: a
			censorship-resistent name-key registration platform: an example of
			this can be found in our email client which operates using a
			decentralized email address name system. Other interesting
			possibilities are building decentralized advertising networks, and
			from there decentralized search engines; mobile billing systems for
			international telecom carriers; and of course genuine micropayments
			and a new monetization method for tech companies....

			<p></p>

			To understand Saito at its most abstract is thus to recognize that
			what it offers is an entirely new type of technical infrastructure,
			one in which the integrity of the data is secured by public-key
			cryptography, and in which the integrity of the network is secured
			through economic incentives. Additionally, and unexpectedly, Saito's
			design also helps us solve two otherwise intractable problems in
			computer science: how to create secure encrypted connections across
			a distributed network, and how to avoid sybil attacks on nodes in a
			blockchain. Understanding how and why these work require a more
			detailed understanding of how Saito works, available in our
			<a href="/docs/transactions.html"
				>technical explanation of proof-of-transactions</a
			>.

			<p></p>

			<h2>Blockchain Scaling</h2>

			<p></p>

			The following table shows current scaling capabilities, which
			reflect the time needed to create and process a single Saito block
			on a 2017 Macbook Air. Specifically, it measures the amount of time
			for the function indexAndStore() in the saito/blockchain.js file to
			execute for a particularly block.

			<p></p>

			<table class="scaling_table">
				<tr>
					<th>Txs</th>
					<th>Tx Size</th>
					<th>Blk Size</th>
					<th>Callbacks</th>
					<th>Genesis Period</th>
					<th>Memory Used</th>
					<th>Processing Time</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>1 MB</td>
					<td>1 MB</td>
					<td>100</td>
					<td>20160</td>
					<td>~200 MB</td>
					<td>1 second</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>25 MB</td>
					<td>25 MB</td>
					<td>100</td>
					<td>20160</td>
					<td>~1500 MB</td>
					<td>24 seconds</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1000</td>
					<td>0.001 MB</td>
					<td>1 MB</td>
					<td>100</td>
					<td>20160</td>
					<td>~800 MB</td>
					<td></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

			<p></p>

			Please note that the above scaling data is significantly
			out-of-date. Transaction capabilities are now among the fastest of
			which we are aware in blockchain technology. Details available on
			request.

				table {
					min-width: 700px;
				}
				th {
					text-align: left;
				}
				td {
					text-align: left;
					padding-right: 10px;
				}
			</style>

			<p></p>

			These figures can be replicated by enabling our Spammer module,
			which can be used to stress-test the network at various levels of
			stress. In practice, the figures will be elevated as they
			necessarily include the time needed to save transactions to a local
			wallet.
