# changelog

## 1.2.0

### Breaking changes

-   **node-sass is no longer supported.**
    -   Since the use of `/` as a division operator is deprecated and warned by dart sass, all divide operations in sass stylesheets were rewritten with dart sass's `math.div()` function. As a result, the .scss files are no longer able to be compiled with node-sass.
    -   Please replace your project's node-sass dependency with [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass).

### Potentially breaking changes

-   **Edge Legacy (non-Chromium Edge) is no longer supported.**
    -   Since Microsoft no longer supports it already and its market share is lower than IE, I decided not to add fallback code for Shadow DOM API.
    -   If your program needs to support Edge Legacy, please use [Web Components polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs).
-   **Date picker element is now inserted after the associated input element by default.**
    -   The default value of the `container` option is changed to `null`.
    -   If your program has the input element inside an element styled with `overflow` other than `visible` and the element doesn't have enough space, the picker will be clipped.
    -   If you need the previous version's behavior to avoid it, please set `'body'` to the container option,
    -   The purpose of this change is to make z-index adjustment in cases like #50 basically unneeded.
    -   This change doesn't apply for inline picker.

### New features

-   Add Bootstrap 5 support (#37, #73)
-   Add Web Components support (#83)
    -   `container` option now accepts HTMLElement instance.

### Bug fix

-   Fix #56 — `minDate`/`maxDate` aren't set to the start/end of month/year when pickLevel > 0 and either format or passed date string doesn't contain the date part.
    -   The same fix is applied to `datesDisabled` as well
-   Fix — picker doesn't hide on unfocus if a date outside the minDate/maxDate range is entered to the input field.
-   Fix — `disableTouchKeyboard` doesn't work
-   Fix — picker doesn't hide on click outside after input is unfocused by closing mobile keyboard (maybe related to #72?)
-   Fix — picker is placed incorrectly when container is user-specified element. (related to #81)

### Changes

-   Change the default placement of `orientation: 'auto'` to bottom-left (#54, #82)

-   Deprecate `disableTouchKeyboard` option. (#78)
-   Change the way to Keep input element focused when clicking picker in order to prevent flicker (#85)
    -   The change also adds capability for users to extend the picker (see #4 in [this comment](https://github.com/mymth/vanillajs-datepicker/issues/85#issuecomment-966604223) - Thank you, @xdev1)
-   Remove keydown event cancellation except arrow keys' preventDefault (#88)
-   Apply the bootstrap-datepicker's locale updates
