# Vanilla JS Datepicker

A vanilla JavaScript remake of [bootstrap-datepicker](https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker) for [Bulma](https://bulma.io) and other CSS frameworks

This package is written from scratch as ECMAScript modules/[Sass](https://sass-lang.com) stylesheets to reproduce similar usability to bootstrap-datepicker.  
It can work either standalone or with CSS framework (e.g. [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Foundation](https://get.foundation)), but works best with [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as it's developed primarily for Bulma.

The package also includes pre-built js/css files for those who like to use it directly on browser.

### Features

-   Date picker (input-dropdown, inline), date range picker
-   Keyboard operation support (navigation by arrow keys, editing on input field)
-   i18n support (locales, CSS-based text direction detection)
-   Easily customizable to adapt stylesheet for various CSS frameworks
-   Dependency free
-   Made for modern browsers — no support for IE and Edge Legacy (aka non-Chromium Edge)  
    _\*\* If you need to support Edge Legacy, [Web Components polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) will allow this library to run on it._
-   Lightweight (well, relatively…) — 34kB (minified, uncompressed)
