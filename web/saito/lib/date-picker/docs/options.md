# Options

There are 2 kinds of config options: the Datepicker options and the DateRangePicker options. The former are for `DatePicker` object and the latter are for `DateRangePicker` object.

Datepicker options can be used with date range picker. And when doing so, you can pass them mixing with DateRangePicker options into one "options" object.

> Datepicker options passed to date range picker are applied to its start- and end-date pickers.

Aside from a couple of exceptions, config options can be updated dynamically using the `setOptions()` method.
